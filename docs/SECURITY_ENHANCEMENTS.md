# R33IS Security Enhancements

## Overview

This document describes the security enhancements implemented for the R33IS application, focusing on three major areas:

1. Cookie-based Authentication
2. Token Refresh Mechanism
3. Comprehensive Input Validation

These improvements significantly enhance the security posture of the application by addressing common vulnerabilities and following industry best practices.

## 1. Cookie-based Authentication

### Implementation Details

The authentication mechanism has been updated to use secure, httpOnly cookies instead of localStorage for token storage.

#### Backend Changes:

- Added cookie-parser middleware to handle cookies
- Created a utility function to set secure authentication cookies
- Modified auth endpoints to set and clear cookies
- Updated authentication middleware to check for tokens in cookies (with fallback to headers)

#### Frontend Changes:

- Updated API service to enable credentials in requests
- Removed token storage in localStorage
- Modified request interceptor to rely on cookies

### Benefits

- **XSS Protection**: Using httpOnly cookies prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the token, protecting against XSS attacks
- **Automatic Token Management**: Cookies are automatically sent with every request, simplifying token management
- **Better Security Posture**: Following security best practices with secure and httpOnly flags

## 2. Token Refresh Mechanism

### Implementation Details

An automatic token refresh mechanism has been implemented to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining security.

#### Backend Changes:

- Added a refresh token endpoint (`/api/auth/refresh`)
- Implemented dual-token strategy (access token and refresh token)
- Set different expiration times for access tokens (1 hour) and refresh tokens (7 days)

#### Frontend Changes:

- Implemented automatic token refresh via response interceptor
- Added refresh token handling in authentication service
- Created error handling for refresh failures

### Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Sessions can be maintained longer without disrupting the user
- **Enhanced Security**: Access tokens have shorter lifespans, minimizing the damage if compromised
- **Graceful Degradation**: Proper handling of token expiration with automatic refresh

## 3. Comprehensive Input Validation

### Implementation Details

A robust validation system has been implemented across both frontend and backend.

#### Backend Changes:

- Created a validation utility module with common validation rules
- Implemented middleware using express-validator for server-side validation
- Added sanitization functions to clean user input
- Implemented security checks for common attack patterns

#### Frontend Changes:

- Created a frontend validation utility with common validation schemas
- Implemented a custom form validation hook for React components
- Added validation to login and customer forms
- Implemented input sanitization to clean user data

### Benefits

- **Layered Defense**: Both client and server-side validation prevents malicious inputs
- **Consistency**: Common validation rules ensure uniform validation across the application
- **User Experience**: Immediate feedback in forms improves usability
- **Security**: Protection against injection attacks and other input-based vulnerabilities

## Implementation Notes

### Cookie Configuration

Cookies are configured with the following security options:

```javascript
{
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  sameSite: 'lax',
  maxAge: 1 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour for access token
  path: '/' // Cookie is valid for all paths
}
```

### CSRF Protection

CSRF protection has been implemented to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks:

- Added csurf middleware for CSRF token generation and validation
- Added `/api/csrf-token` endpoint to provide tokens to the client
- Modified frontend to include CSRF tokens with non-GET requests
- Configured CSRF cookies with appropriate security settings

### Input Validation Examples

Server-side validation:

```javascript
const validationRules = {
  auth: {
    login: [
      body('username').optional().trim().isString().isLength({ min: 3, max: 50 })
        .withMessage('Username must be between 3 and 50 characters'),
      body('customerNumber').optional().trim().isNumeric()
        .withMessage('Customer number must be numeric'),
      body('password').notEmpty().withMessage('Password is required')
    ],
    // Additional rules...
  }
};
```

Client-side validation:

```javascript
const schemas = {
  login: {
    username: {
      required: 'Username is required',
    },
    password: {
      required: 'Password is required',
    },
  },
  // Additional schemas...
};
```

## Testing & Verification

The new security features have been tested for:

1. **Successful Authentication**: Verifying tokens are properly set in cookies
2. **Automatic Token Refresh**: Testing refresh behavior before expiration
3. **CSRF Protection**: Ensuring cross-site requests are blocked
4. **Input Validation**: Testing invalid inputs are properly rejected

## Future Enhancements

Potential future security improvements:

1. Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
2. Add two-factor authentication
3. Improve logging for security events
4. Regular security audits and penetration testing
5. Implement content security policy (CSP) headers
